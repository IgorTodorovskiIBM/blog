Welcome to Mainframe Demystified, the blog dedicated to unraveling the intricacies of the mainframe world. I'm Igor Todorovski.

As an avid z/OS developer and open source enthusiast, I bridge the gap between these two realms, bringing you the best of both worlds. With a deep understanding of mainframe technologies and a passion for exploring open-source innovations, I strive to demystify the complexities surrounding mainframe development.

I've had the opportunity to tackle Node.js and Swift on z/OS to diving into emerging open-source tools, I thrive on combining cutting-edge techniques with the robustness of the mainframe platform.

My journey has led me to contribute actively to the z/OS Open Source project on GitHub. By integrating the latest open-source technologies with z/OS, I enable developers to leverage powerful tools that were previously reserved for other platforms. Through my work, I aim to break down the barriers that often hinder mainframe developers from accessing the full potential of open source.

Solving complex challenges is the beating heart of my work. Whether it's optimizing mainframe performance, enhancing system security, or streamlining development processes, I relentlessly seek innovative solutions. By demystifying these intricate topics, I empower fellow mainframe enthusiasts to unlock new possibilities and push the boundaries of what can be achieved in the mainframe realm.

Mainframe Demystified is not just a blog; it's a community. I actively engage with other developers, both within the mainframe ecosystem and the wider open-source community. Through conferences, meetups, and online forums, I foster knowledge sharing and collaboration, because I believe that together we can achieve more and propel the mainframe world forward.

Thank you for being a part of Mainframe Demystified, and I look forward to the enlightening journey ahead!
