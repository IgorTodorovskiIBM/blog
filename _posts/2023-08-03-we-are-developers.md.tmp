My first trip to Berlin proved to be an unforgettable adventure as I attended the highly anticipated [WeAreDevelopers World Congress](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress).

The WeAreDevelopers Congress is aimed at developers and celebrates the very essence of software development and bringing together brilliant minds from all corners of the globe. Listening to the inspiring stories shared by industry legends like John Romero and Joel Spolsky left me in awe of their accomplishments. The opportunity to hear Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the World Wide Web, speak about his groundbreaking project, Solid, was a privledge as well!

Admist the engaging sessions and discussions, I had the chance to present my own session on "Unlocking the Power of z/OS via Open Source." I was geniuenly impress with the audience's keen interest and enthusiasm towards z/OS.  It was gratifying to witness the exchange of ideas and the sense of collaboration.

The experience at WeAreDevelopers Berlin was made even more rewarding by the enthusiastic response and genuine interest in my session on "Unlocking the Power of z/OS via Open Source." The audience's curiosity about z/OS was amazing to see, and it was heartening to witness the eagerness with which they delved into the intricacies of this powerful platform.

Throughout the session, questions poured in, covering a diverse range of topics related to z/OS. Some attendees inquired about the supported versions of Java on the platform, seeking to optimize their development environments. Others were intrigued by the success stories of companies that had migrated from the Cloud to z/OS, eager to learn how such a transition could help reduce latency and enhance performance.

The interest in containerization was particularly noteworthy, as developers sought to explore modern deployment approaches on z/OS. These questions showcased a genuine desire to embrace innovative practices while leveraging the reliability and scalability offered by this time-tested platform.

The engaging discussions that followed the session fostered an atmosphere of camaraderie and knowledge-sharing. As developers and industry professionals exchanged insights and experiences, it became evident that the developer community was a tightly-knit network of passionate individuals, eager to learn and grow together.

WeAreDevelopers Berlin served as a melting pot of cultures, ideas, and innovation, with over 5,000 IT professionals and students coming together. The networking opportunities were unparalleled, providing an ideal platform for making connections, expanding career prospects, and building lasting friendships. Witnessing the camaraderie among like-minded individuals, united by their passion for all things development, was truly inspiring.

Beyond the conference halls, Berlin's historical landmarks beckoned, and I found myself immersed in the city's captivating past. The remnants of the Berlin Wall and the iconic Brandenburg Gate stood as powerful reminders of the city's tumultuous history. Exploring the city's cultural treasures, such as the impressive Museum Island and the charming streets of Mitte, added a touch of wonder to my overall experience.

In response to this overwhelming interest, our team is now more focused than ever on creating public-facing machines for z/OS. These accessible environments will provide aspiring developers with an opportunity to get hands-on experience and explore the vast potential of this robust platform. By lowering the barriers to entry, we hope to encourage more developers to embrace z/OS and contribute to its growth and innovation.

In conclusion, WeAreDevelopers Berlin not only celebrated the brilliance of developers but also revealed the potential of nurturing a vibrant community of z/OS enthusiasts. The event left an indelible mark on my journey as a developer, and I am excited to continue contributing to the growth and accessibility of z/OS for all aspiring developers.
