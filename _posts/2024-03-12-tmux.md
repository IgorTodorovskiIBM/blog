I'm excited to share my journey of porting [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), a popular terminal multiplexer, to z/OS! This project builds upon my previous experience successfully porting GNU screen and making it available under the [z/OS Open Tools](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools) umbrella. Following the success of GNU screen, the z/OS community expressed a strong desire for tmux in a [recent poll](https://github.com/orgs/ZOSOpenTools/discussions/433), making it one of the most requested tools for z/OS.

**So what is Tmux?**
> tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.

Tmux has many advantages over GNU Screen, including mouse integration, supporting terminal splitting into both vertical and horizontal panes, and generally many more configuration options.

## Why Tmux on z/OS?

For z/OS users, particularly system administrators and developers, efficient management of multiple shell sessions is critical for efficiency. 

Tmux provides the following features:

* **Multi-pane Workspaces:** Organize your terminal by splitting the window into panes, each running an independent program. This is great when you're building and editing at the same time like me!
* **Detachable Sessions:** Leave your work running on z/OS even after disconnecting. Reattach seamlessly from any terminal later. This means you can finish working, sleep and then resume where you left off the following morning.
* **Enhanced Workflow:** Easily switch between tasks, monitor multiple processes concurrently, and maintain a clutter-free terminal environment. This is one vital for me since I sometimes work on 5+ different tasks during the day.

Why not run tmux on Linux? You can certainly run tmux remotely from a Linux machine to manage your screen sessions, but being able to run it locally on z/OS can reduce latency and is especially good for air-gapped environments.


## How do I install it?

Grab it from z/OS Open Tools using the `zopen` package manager:

```
zopen install tmux -y
```

Then run it:
```
tmux
```

## Porting Tmux to z/OS

Porting tmux to z/OS presented unique challenges due to the underlying differences between z/OS and traditional Unix-like systems. Let's explore some key areas and the solutions implemented:

* **Missing dependencies**: Tmux in itself does not have that many library dependencies. It depends on libevent and ncurses. Fortunately ncurses has already been ported for other projects like Vim and Less so I only had to focus on getting libevent ported.

* **I/O Handling:** Standard Unix I/O operations might require special handling on z/OS. We leveraged functionalities provided by ZOSLIB (introduced in the [previous blog post](https://igortodorovskiibm.github.io/blog/)) to simplify I/O handling. 

## Conquering Dependency Challenges:

By leveraging the [zopen build framework](https://zosopentools.github.io/meta/#/Guides/Porting), I was able to port libevent fairly easily. The port is available at [https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport). Since libevent is a library, I had to make sure I exposed it as a library when I was adding it as a dependency for Tmux with the following additions to its [buildenv](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport/blob/main/buildenv#L16-L26) file:

```
  export ZOPEN_EXTRA_CFLAGS="\${ZOPEN_EXTRA_CFLAGS} -I\$PWD/include"
  export ZOPEN_EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="\${ZOPEN_EXTRA_CXXFLAGS} -I\$PWD/include"
  export ZOPEN_EXTRA_LDFLAGS="\${ZOPEN_EXTRA_LDFLAGS} -L\$PWD/lib"
  export ZOPEN_EXTRA_LIBS="\${ZOPEN_EXTRA_LIBS} -levent"
```
For a detailed look on how I built it, check out the entire buildenv configuration here [https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport/blob/main/buildenv](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport/blob/main/buildenv).

Now I was ready to build Tmux.

## Building tmux

tmux's buildenv configuration was relatively [simple](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/tmuxport/blob/main/buildenv). We added the known dependencies (libevent, ncurses, make, and a few others) and chose the Clang compiler for building. To build it, I used the `zopen build` framework.

```
zopen build -v
```

Unfortunately, tmux had a number of issues at build and runtime and I'll go through a few of them.

## Overcoming the `forkpty` hurdle

`forkpty` is needed by tmux but is absent on z/OS, so I employed an alternative approach utilizing existing C LE apis. This involved creating a pseudo terminal by opening specific devices and manipulating terminal attributes to simulate a terminal environment for tmux sessions. You can find the patch [here](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/tmuxport/blob/main/patches/forkpty-zos.c.patch).

## Testing and Debugging the Build

After testing the build of tmux, I was presented with garbled output immediately! To understand the issue, I leveraged tmux's `-v` option for logging. After further investigation, I realized that the content written to the screen was actually readable and in ASCII format but it wasn't being converted back to IBM-1047 for the terminal.

The culprit? `writev` was not respecting file tags and auto-conversion. This meant the text going to standard output wasn't being automatically converted to the terminal's CCSID (IBM-1047).

To resolve this, I modified the libevent code to use `write` instead of `writev`. This meant I had to create a patch for libevent [here](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport/blob/main/patches/buffer.c.patch).

This enabled tmux to render text correctly, but I wasn't done yet. The newline characters didn't seem to register. This resulted in the prompt line being printed without a newline! 

After comparing the `stty` output from a working terminal to that of the tmux created terminal, I noticed that the flags OPOST and ONLCR were missing. Adding them [back in the tmux C code](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/tmuxport/blob/main/patches/spawn.c.patch#L11) fixed it!

The last major issue was with regards to socketpair. Tmux uses socketpairs instead of pipes for interprocess communication, but socketpairs (as of z/OS 2.4) do not support auto-conversion. Changing the code to [use pipes instead of socketpairs](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/tmuxport/blob/2dc478690641fa88a4596c64c873fae0c20ad2e0/patches/job.c.patch#L10) fixed this issue!

There's still a lingering issue when using /bin/sh as the default shell. So for now I set my tmux default shell to bash to overcome it in my `$HOME/.tmux.conf` tmux config file as follows:

```
vim $HOME/.tmux.conf
# Now add the following line
set-option -g default-shell $ZOPEN_PKGINSTALL/bash/bash/bin/bash
```

For a more involved tmux.config file, you can check mine out [here](https://github.com/IgorTodorovskiIBM/tmux.conf/blob/main/.tmux.conf).


# Next Steps
There's still a few issues remaining, but for the most part tmux is pretty much functional. Here's what remains:

* Resolve issues when using /bin/sh as the default shell
* Migrating the forkpty and writev changes to the common zoslib library
