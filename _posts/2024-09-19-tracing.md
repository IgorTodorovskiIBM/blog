# Enabling Tracing with Clang on z/OS

As a member of the [zopen-community](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools), I’ve had the chance to port a wide range of open-source tools to z/OS. It’s always exciting when you get a tool running smoothly on z/OS, especially when it makes your workflow easier. However, even when everything seems to be working fine, performance issues or memory leaks can still creep in. While IPCS is great for deep-dive debugging, I've never become proficient in it. I wanted something more modern and visual. In this post, I’ll walk you through how I addressed this using Clang’s instrumentation features and [Perfetto](https://perfetto.dev/)’s trace visualization and show how you can easily apply them in your projects.

If you don't care about the tracing implementation, you can skip over to [Visualizing the Trace data using Perfetto](#visualizing-the-trace-data-using-perfetto) for how to leverage it.

## Compiler Tracing with Clang

To start, I discovered Clang's `-finstrument-functions` feature, available in IBM Open XL C/C++. This option automatically inserts instrumentation code at each function entry and exit point, making it possible to collect detailed tracing metrics. With the instrumented code, I could easily capture function names, timestamps, and other data, all of which are essential for profiling performance and diagnosing issues.

### Integrating with zoslib

Clang's `-finstrument-functions` feature only requires two functions to be implemented: `__cyg_profile_func_enter` and `__cyg_profile_func_exit`. By leveraging these, I was able to capture the function names using the Program Prologue Area (PPA1), along with the timestamps, process IDs (PIDs), and thread IDs (TIDs). After successfully testing the prototype, I integrated it into zoslib, a foundational open-source library for building C/C++ projects on z/OS.

Zoslib is linked into 99% of the C/C++ projects within the zopen community. If you want to learn more about zoslib, check my other blog [here](https://igortodorovskiibm.github.io/blog/2024/02/12/zoslib-library/).

#### Standardizing Trace Data Format

While the prototype was defeinitely a step up over what I had before, it was still difficult to analyze the data. I needed a way to generate the trace data into a more consumable format. One such standardized format is the [Chrome Tracing JSON format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview). This format offers several advantages:
*   Readability on z/OS via the `jq` command since the trace data will be in json.
*   Compatibility with Chrome's built-in tracing feature and [Perfetto open source](https://perfetto.dev/).

### Trace Data Structure

The Chrome Tracing format stores each function call as a JSON object with these attributes:

*   Function name
*   Timestamp
*   PID
*   TID
*   Phase ("B" for function entry, "E" for function exit)

To make the traces more manageable, especially for long-running applications, I implemented automatic gzip compression. After the trace is generated, a check ensures that gzip is available, and if so, the trace file is compressed. This keeps the file sizes under control, but if gzip fails for some reason, the trace file remains uncompressed, and the application continues as normal.

## Next Step - Memory Allocation

Another pain point for me on z/OS was tracing memory allocations. IPCS is powerful, but again I needed something more accessible for memory footprint analysis. So, I figured why not extend this tracing to handle memory management too? 

So that's what I did. I implemented custom overrides for `malloc` and `free` to track heap memory spikes and allocation patterns.

The current implementation is available in zoslib [here](https://github.com/ibmruntimes/zoslib/edit/zopen2/src/zos-instrumentation.cc)

And here's an example of the generated json for git on z/OS:
```json
{ "traceEvents": [
  {"cat": "PERF", "name": "zoslib_env_hook", "ph": "B", "pid": 83893699, "tid": 1, "ts": 582917421},
  {"cat": "malloc", "name": "Memory", "ph": "C", "pid": 83893699, "tid": 1, "ts": 582922816, "args": {"delta_memory": 1024, "total_memory": 1024}},

  ...
```

## Visualizing the trace data using Perfetto

Once I had the mechanism in place to generate trace data into a standardized format, the next step was analysis. This is what led me to Perfetto, an open source trace visualization tool that offers an interactive UI to inspect your program’s execution in detail.

Perfetto is really easy to use. It lets you zoom in on specific timeframes, analyze function call stacks visually, and filter events by category or thread. It even supports SQL queries on your trace data, which opens up a lot of possibilities for custom analysis.

Here's a look at the performance visualization for `git status`:

With Perfetto, you can visualize your program’s entire call flow and easily track memory spikes.

## How to leverage the tracing in z/OS Open Tools

### Using zopen build --instrument for Easy Tracing

While this was very great, I now wanted a way to make it easy for every one contributing to zopen to leverage this tracing capability.

So, I incorporated this functionality into the zopen build framework by adding a `--instrument` option:

```sh
zopen build --instrument
```
With this option, the open source project is built with instrumentation enabled (applies only to C/C++ projects). 

Then, when the instrumented application runs, it generates a <application>-<timestamp>.json.gz file that contains the trace data. Note, you can override this location and filename by setting the ZOSLIB_PROF_PATH environment variable: `export ZOSLIB_PROF_PATH="/path/to/custom/tracefile.json"`. You may want to do this in if space is an issue on your system.

## Viewing Trace Data

Now that you have a trace file, the next step is to perform the analysis.

To view the trace data, there are three approaches:
* Manual inspection of the json
* Using perfetto (preferred)

### Manual inspection:

* Using zcat and jq: You can decompress and inspect the JSON trace data directly from the command line:

```sh
zcat <application>-<timestamp>.json.gz | jq .
```

* Using Perfetto UI

The json file can be loaded into the Perfetto UI for a detailed view of the execution.


#### Steps to view traces in Perfetto UI:

1.  Visit the [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/) using a browser.
2.  Download the generated json.gz file from z/OS and then click on 'Open Trace file' in the Perfetto UI.
3.  Explore the timeline to see detailed function calls, filter by specific processes or threads, and identify bottlenecks.

You can use the W/A/S/D keys to maneuaver around. 

Using Perfetto, I could now visually identify spikes in memory footprint and identify the culprit functions:

#### Using the SQL Query engine for custom analysis

Perfetto also offers a Python library, which I haven’t had the chance to explore yet, but it opens up the possibility for custom analysis and even integrating with large language models (LLMs) for deeper insights.

Additionally, Perfetto's built-in SQL query engine allows you to easily locate long-running tasks and perform advanced data queries. Here's a simple example to find the longest-running operations:

```sql
SELECT ts, dur, name FROM slice ORDER BY dur DESC
```
This makes it easy to dig into specific performance bottlenecks and get a more granular view of your application's behavior.

## Next Steps
I look forward to using this to potentially improve performance and memory related issues in z/OS Open Tools. 

## Conclusion
Thank you to everyone from the z/OS Open Tools community, and the IBM Open XL C/C++ team for providing an awesome C/C++ compiler for z/OS!
