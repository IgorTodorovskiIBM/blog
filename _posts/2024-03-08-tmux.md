I'm excited to share my journey of porting [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), a popular terminal multiplexer, to z/OS! This project builds upon my previous experience successfully porting GNU screen and making it available under the z/OS Open Tools umbrella. Following the success of GNU screen, the z/OS community expressed a strong desire for tmux in a [recent poll](https://github.com/orgs/ZOSOpenTools/discussions/433), making it one of the most requested tools.

**So what is Tmux?**
> tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.

Tmux has many advantages of GNU Screen, including mouse integration, supporting terminal splitting into both vertical and horizontal panes, and generally many more configuration options.

## Why Tmux on z/OS?

For z/OS users, particularly system administrators and developers, efficient management of multiple shell sessions is critical for efficiency. 

Tmux provides the following features:

* **Multi-pane Workspaces:** Organize your terminal by splitting the window into panes, each running an independent program. This is great when you're building and editing at the same time.
* **Detachable Sessions:** Leave your work running on z/OS even after disconnecting. Reattach seamlessly from any terminal later. This means you can sleep and resume where you left off the following morning.
* **Enhanced Workflow:** Easily switch between tasks, monitor multiple processes concurrently, and maintain a clutter-free terminal environment. This is one vital for me since I sometimes work on 5+ different tasks during the day.

You can certainly run tmux remotely from a Linux machine to manage your screen sessions, but being able to run it locally on z/OS can reduce latency and is especially good for air-gapped environments.


## How do I install it?

Grab it from z/OS Open Tools using the `zopen` package manager:

```
zopen install tmux -y
```

Then run it:
```
tmux
```

## Porting Tmux to z/OS

Porting tmux to z/OS presented unique challenges due to the underlying differences between z/OS and traditional Unix-like systems. Let's explore some key areas and the solutions implemented:

* **Missing dependencies**: Tmux in itself does not have that many dependencies. It depends on libevent and ncurses. Fortunately ncurses has already been ported for other projects like Vim and Less so we only had to focus on getting libevent ported.

* **I/O Handling:** Standard Unix I/O operations might require special handling on z/OS. We leveraged functionalities provided by ZOSLIB (introduced in the [previous blog post](https://igortodorovskiibm.github.io/blog/) to simplify I/O handling. 

## Conquering Dependency Challenges:

By leveraging the [zopen build framework](https://zosopentools.github.io/meta/#/Guides/Porting), we were able to port libevent fairly easily. The port is available at [https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport). Since libevent is a library, we had to make sure we exposed it as a library when we were adding it as a depedenceny for Tmux with the following additions:

```
  export ZOPEN_EXTRA_CFLAGS="\${ZOPEN_EXTRA_CFLAGS} -I\$PWD/include"
  export ZOPEN_EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="\${ZOPEN_EXTRA_CXXFLAGS} -I\$PWD/include"
  export ZOPEN_EXTRA_LDFLAGS="\${ZOPEN_EXTRA_LDFLAGS} -L\$PWD/lib"
  export ZOPEN_EXTRA_LIBS="\${ZOPEN_EXTRA_LIBS} -levent"
```
For a detailed look on how we built it, check out the buildenv configuration here [https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport/blob/main/buildenv](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport/blob/main/buildenv).

Now we were ready to build Tmux.

## Building tmux

tmux's buildenv configuration was relatively [simple](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/tmuxport/blob/main/buildenv)). We added the known dependencies (libevent, ncurses, make, and a few others) and chose the Clang compiler for building. To build it, we used the `zopen build` framework.

```
zopen build -v
```

Unfortunately, tmux had a number of issues at build and runtime and I'll go through a few of them.

## Overcoming the `forkpty` Challenge

`forkpty` is needed by tmux but is absent on z/OS, so we employed an alternative approach utilizing existing C LE apis. This involved creating a pseudo terminal by opening specific devices and manipulating terminal attributes to simulate a terminal environment for tmux sessions. You can find the patches [here](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/tmuxport/tree/main/patches).

## Testing and Debugging the Build

After testing the build of tmux, we encountered garbled output immediately. To understand the issue, we leveraged tmux's `-v` option for logging. After further investigation, we realized that the content written to the screen was actually readable and in ASCII format but it wasn't being converted back to IBM-1047 for the terminal.

The culprit? `writev` was not respecting file tags and auto-conversion. This meant the text going to standard output wasn't being automatically converted to the terminal's CCSID (IBM-1047).

To resolve this, we modified the libevent code to use `write` instead of `writev`. This meant we had to create a patch for libevent [here](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/libeventport/blob/main/patches/buffer.c.patch).

This enabled tmux to render text correctly, but we weren't done yet. The newline characters didn't seem to register. This resulted in the prompt line being printed without a newline! 

After comparing the stty output from a working terminal to that of the tmux created terminal, I noticed that the flags OPOST and ONLCR were missed. That fixed it!

The last major issue was with regards to socketpair. Tmux uses socketpairs instead of pipes for interprocess communication, but socketpaires (as of z/OS 2.4) do not support auto-conversion. Changing it to use pipes worked!

There's still a lingering issue when using /bin/sh as the default shell. So for now I set my tmux default shell to bash to overcome it in my `$HOME/.tmux.conf` file as follows:

```
set-option -g default-shell /home/itodoro/zopen/usr/local/bin/bash
```

# Next Steps

* Migrating the forkpty and writev changes to the common zoslib library
* Resolve issues when using /bin/sh as the default shell

# Thank you
